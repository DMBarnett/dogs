        <p>Dogs were some of the first animals domesticated by mankind, as early hunters and gatherers adopted friendly wolves into their groups.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Although they come in many shapes and sizes today, they all come from early descendents of wolves, and share many of the same characteristics.</p>
